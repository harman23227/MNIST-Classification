How PCA Affects Classification Performance:
	No PCA (Direct FDA):
		FDA_LDA:
			Train Accuracy: 0.973
			Test Accuracy: 0.957
			Not much drop from training to testing, so it’s generalizing well.
			Class 1 Precision (0.916) is a bit low, so it's getting some false positives.
		FDA_QDA:

			Train Accuracy: 0.963
			Test Accuracy: 0.967
			QDA’s doing better than LDA, because it can handle more complex class boundaries.
			Pretty balanced performance across all classes.
			
	PCA with 95% Variance (PCA95_LDA):
	
		Train Accuracy: 0.997
		Test Accuracy: 0.967
		Highest train accuracy so far, with most precesion.
		Class-wise Breakdown:
			Class 0 is nearly perfect with F1 of 0.995.
			Class 2’s Recall (0.910) is a bit low, so it’s missing some true positives.
			Overall, great balance, and noise reduction from PCA.
		
	PCA with 90% Variance (PCA90_LDA):
	
		Train Accuracy: 0.987
		Test Accuracy: 0.957
		slightly lower accuracy than PCA90_LDA and a little less overfitting.
		Class-wise Breakdown:
			Class 1 and Class 2 have slightly better Precision and Recall compared to PCA95.
			Class 0’s performance stays top-notch.
			This one seems to have the best balance overall—enough components to keep useful info without too much noise.
		
	PCA with 2 Components (PCA2_LDA):
	
		Train Accuracy: 0.913
		Test Accuracy: 0.937
		Lowest Accuracy among all the classifiers. Looks like 2 components just aren’t enough to capture the info.
		Class-wise Breakdown:
			Class 2 has the lowest F1 (0.908) among all models, so it’s struggling with this class the most.
			Class 1 also has a lower F1 compared to other models, meaning it’s misclassifying more.
			This confirms that oversimplifying the data isn’t doing the model any favors.
