# MNIST-Classification
MNIST Classification using MLE, PCA, FDA,  and Discriminant Analysis.
Handwritten Digit Classification (0, 1, 2)

Overview

This project explores classification techniques on a subset of the MNIST dataset. The objective is to classify digits 0, 1, and 2 using statistical and dimensionality reduction methods.

Dataset

Subset of MNIST containing only digits 0, 1, and 2.

Training set: 100 randomly selected samples per class (Total: 300 samples).

Test set: 100 randomly selected samples per class (Total: 300 samples).

Approach

1. Data Preprocessing

Filter out digits 0, 1, and 2.

Normalize image pixel values to [0,1].

Convert images into feature vectors.

2. MLE Estimation

Estimate class-wise mean and covariance assuming a Gaussian distribution.

Compute likelihood using:



3. Dimensionality Reduction

PCA: Reduce features while preserving 95% variance.

FDA: Optimize class separability by computing between-class and within-class scatter matrices.

4. Classification

Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).

Evaluate classification accuracy on test data.

Experiments

Compare LDA and QDA performance.

Analyze PCAâ€™s effect on classification.

Experiment with different PCA variance thresholds (e.g., 90%).

Visualize PCA and FDA transformed feature spaces.
